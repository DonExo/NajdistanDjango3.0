# NajdiStan.mk - rework to Django v.3

This is a rework of the original Najdistan.mk application that was built initially with Flask.
The application can be found at: [http://najdistan-mk.herokuapp.com](http://najdistan-mk.herokuapp.com])

The application is hosted on Heroku's free tier and the initial loading (landing) of the website can be slow until their dyno's start up. Subsequent requests will function normally.

This is a WIP (Work in Progress). There is still no style added to it, just some basic bootstrapping.
